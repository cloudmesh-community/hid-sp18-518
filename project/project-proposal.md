## Scope of work
- Value Hypothesis
- Cycle time metrics on porting a solution without boto/libcloud
- Lead time metrics on use of RESTful APIs compared to command line usage
- RESTful API
  - Swagger development to design/build API services for UI
  - Python development to leverage boto/libcloud
  - Evidence of success porting a solution from/to AWS, Azure, Google Cloud
- Comparison of porting solution manually to libcloud/boto by command line
- Comparison of porting solution with libcloud/boto by commandline to RESTful API solution
- Conclusion

## Technology Stack



## Special Consideration to Project Format
Swagger API documentation
